## About me
Since last year I've been expanding my knowledge of testing and technical skills. I haven't lost my motivation to learn and I would like to gain experience. Below are the projects I did as part of my study (currently expanding my knowledge of Java and Selenium). I'm also exploring the possibilities of Cypress.


## [Manual Test Cases for Statistical Process Control](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UuBd6j9zmAqWEOTCTnm7ZSJqYeanwAT4/view?usp=sharing) 
> *Based on Software Requirements Specification for web application. Statistical Process Control(SPC) is used to manage for any production process. Application helps ensure the process operates efficiently, producing more specification-conforming product with less waste. The project inculdes sample test cases involving JIRA (RTM)*
## [Library Simulator](https://github.com/MichnaSylwia/LibrarySimulator-github)
> *Maven project in Java programming language, which is used to manage the library*
## [REST API tests](https://github.com/MichnaSylwia/rest-api-test-lab)
> *The project includes automated sample tests using Java and RestAssured*
## [Java+Selenium+TestNG tests](https://github.com/MichnaSylwia/selenium-java-spc)
> Sample tests for Statistical Process Control(SPC) web application using Java,Selenium and TestNG based on Page Object Pattern
## [Cypress API tests](https://github.com/MichnaSylwia/cypress-api-testing)
> *API testing that includes typical HTTP requests. Test data for 50 users generated with faker and hosted with json-server*
## [Cypress UI tests](https://github.com/MichnaSylwia/cypress-ui-testing-todo-list)
> *Functional tests for Todo List web application*
