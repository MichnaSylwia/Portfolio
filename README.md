## About me
I'm a graduate Quality Assurance at AGH University of Science and Technology. Since last year I have been expanding my knowledge of testing and technical skills. I haven't lost my motivation to learn and I would like to gain experience. I'm a quality enthusiast who prefers to solve the assigned tasks right away and not postpone them until later.
